# An Alexa skill that joins AWS Lambda and AWS SNS to message your friends
<p>Welcome! This tutorial was designed for the attendees of the University of Illinois' <a href="https://sail.cs.illinois.edu/">CS@ILLINOIS SAIL</a>, an event for high school students to explore various student-led classes at the University.
  <br>However, this tutorial is meant for anyone to use!
</p>
<p>This presentation was a slight adaptation of <a href="https://github.com/mrvivacious/">Vivek Bhookya</a>'s 2018 version.</p>

### What?

<p>
  We will be building an Alexa skill that sends your personalized messages to recipients of your choice via SMS.
  <br>This walkthrough uses the Alexa developer dashboard for the voice user interface design and AWS Lambda and AWS SNS to handle the recipient selection and message delivery function.
